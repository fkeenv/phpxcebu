# PHPxCebu

This application is used for managing our local meetups.


What do we need?
- Events
  - Add a page to join/register for the event
- Participants/Users
  - Question? Do we require them to create an account and login to join an event?
  - Or do we allow guests to join an event. Guest is someone who does not have an account



Future features:
- QR scanning
- Raffle
- Speaker notes


TODOs:
- Make the registration page pretty (resources/views/livewire/event-registration.blade.php)
- Send Confirmation email to participants after registration
- On registration page, add a "un-join button"

Misc todo:
- add linting (pint)
- add static analysis (larastan)
- optionally add rector (not a big deal though)
